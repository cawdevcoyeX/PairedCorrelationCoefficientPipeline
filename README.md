# PairedCorrelationCoefficientPipeline
Personal Project to create and train models on stock correlation data. 

This is a personal project designed to enable me to create and train multiple models on pairs of stocks. Its designed to predict their correlation coefficients at various time intervals. 

It has support for creating a set of indicators. Downloading data. Cleaning that data. Transforming that data into proper format (Timestamps, DateTime range, etc). And fitting models to the data.
